# Generation-and-detection-of-Ai-Images


Welcome to the AI Face Generation and Detection project, a cutting-edge application that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to generate realistic human face images and detect whether an image has been AI-generated or not. With a robust tech stack featuring React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and FastAPI with Python for model training and detection, this project offers a comprehensive solution for image generation and verification tasks.


### Key Features:
1. Realistic AI Face Generation: Utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, our platform can generate highly realistic human face images. These AI-generated faces exhibit diverse characteristics and expressions, making them suitable for various applications such as virtual avatars, character design, and image synthesis.

2. Image-to-Image Generation: In addition to creating faces from scratch, our platform allows users to generate new images based on existing ones. By leveraging the power of generative models, users can transform ordinary images into visually stunning creations, adding a new dimension of creativity and customization.

3. AI-Generated Image Detection: With the proliferation of AI-generated content, it has become crucial to distinguish between real and synthetic images. Our platform includes a robust detection mechanism powered by state-of-the-art models such as ResNet-50, VGG, and DenseNet. By analyzing key features and patterns, our system can accurately determine whether an image has been generated by AI algorithms.


## Tech Stack:

### Frontend: 
Developed using React.js, the frontend provides a sleek and intuitive interface for users to interact with the platform's features. Responsive design and smooth navigation ensure a seamless user experience across devices.

### Backend:
Node.js serves as the backend framework, handling data processing, API requests, and server-side logic. Its asynchronous architecture ensures efficient handling of concurrent operations, enhancing overall system performance.

### FastAPI with Python:
FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python, powers the backend for model training and image detection. Leveraging Python's extensive libraries and tools, we train deep learning models such as ResNet-50, VGG, and DenseNet to perform image analysis and classification tasks.
